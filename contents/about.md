I am a highly motivated <b>Software Engineer</b> and <b>Scrum Master</b> with 10 years IT experience, very experienced in design and development of Java software solutions (front and back end)

My strong technical skills are in: <b>Web Services, REST API, J2EE, Spring, JavaScript and Web solutions</b>.

Over the four years, in addition to <b>Java</b> and <b>NodeJs</b> development, I have also taken responsibility for management processes and have gained good experience in scrum methodology. Hands-on development remains one of my core passions and I am happy to be involved in development and analysis.

My the biggest project was implemented on Germany market and it was music live streaming platform. At the beginning of this project I was responsible for development and implementation but as the team had grown I was concentrated on <b>Scrum</b> process, analysing and gathering requirements from customers.

In most of my projects the database layer was implemented on <b>MySQL</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> using <b>Hibernate</b> or <b>MyBatis</b> but I have also experience with <b>Remedy/BMC</b> Product based on <b>Oracle</b> database.

I have worked in many different projects, technologies and environments. This has given me a very strong and broad experience, which enables me to quickly understand new projects, technologies and approaches. I am adaptable and very keen to further my career in a <b>Java/NodeJS/Web based environment</b>.
