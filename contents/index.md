<b>Welcome</b> on my website. I'm Software Developer/Architect with very well knowledge of agile methodologies and with entrepreneurial skills, based in London.
My contact with IT and software was from very young years. I wrote then my first quiz, which was fully implemented in batch files on DOS.
I used then Norton Commander as text user interface. That experience and history which I had from my youth helped me to do different experiments and helped to build awareness, how to find a solution to very complex problems.
