<b>Welcome</b> on my website. I'm Software Developer with very well knowledge of Agile methodologies based in London.
My contact with software was from very young years. The first program which i wrote was the Quiz in DOS system. 
I used then the first version of Norton Commander as text user interface. 
After this experience, my IT skills improved from one year to another.
