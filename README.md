You need to have **node**

## Quick-start

First install wintersmith using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

```bash
$ npm install wintersmith -g
```

This will install wintersmith globally on your system so that you can access the `wintersmith` command from anywhere.


```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install all project dependances

```bash
$ wintersmith preview
```

At this point you are ready to start preview your site. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` display web page

When done run:

```bash
$ wintersmith build
```

This generates your site and places it in the `build/` directory - all ready to be copied to your web server!
